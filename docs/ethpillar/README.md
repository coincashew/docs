| Lido CSM Staking         | Start staking with as little as 2.4 ETH                       | consensus execution validator mevboost  |
| Full Node Only           | Run your own ETH node, also known as RPC node                 | consensus execution                     |
| Failover Staking Node    | Deploy backup beacon nodes for redundancy                     | consensus execution mevboost            |
| Validator Only           | Run a validator client separately, connect to existing Failover/Solo staking/RocketPool node          | validator |
| Lido CSM Validator Only  | Run a CSM validator client separately, connect to existing Failover/Solo staking/RocketPool node      | validator |
