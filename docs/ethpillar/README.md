### What you can do with EthPillar

EthPillar empowers solo home stakers and node runners with a seamless installation and node management textual user interface (TUI). No complex terminal commands are needed, making running your own full node or validator node highly accessible, fast, and easy.

Here's a list of common node configurations and common uses.

| Configuration            | Enables you to    | Consists of |
| :----------------:       | :------           | :------         | 
| Solo Staking Node        | Run your own solo staking node stack, the gold standard       | consensus execution validator mevboost  |
| Lido CSM Staking         | Start staking with as little as 2.4 ETH                       | consensus execution validator mevboost  |
| Full Node Only           | Run your own ETH node, also known as RPC node                 | consensus execution                     |
| Failover Staking Node    | Deploy backup beacon nodes for redundancy                     | consensus execution mevboost            |
| Validator Only           | Run a validator client separately, connect to existing Failover/Solo staking/RocketPool node          | validator |
| Lido CSM Validator Only  | Run a CSM validator client separately, connect to existing Failover/Solo staking/RocketPool node      | validator |
