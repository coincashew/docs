If **LOCAL**, ethpillar will install a **Nimbus+Nethermind** full node.
	- Select **Sepolia** as network
	- Answer **Yes** to start syncing now
	- Answer **Yes** to autostart when system boots up
	- Nimbus+Nethermind full node will require 2+hrs to sync on a system with fast NVME ssd drives

5. Congrats! aztec-sequencer is now installed.

## ‚è≠Ô∏è Next Steps:

1. **Review .env configuration**: Update values (i.e. your ETH addresses/keys) if desired

2. **Start aztec-sequencer**: Ensure Sepolia Full Node is fully synced first! This can take at least a few hours. Run the Health Checks.

3. **Backup aztec validator key**: Use the üîê menu option
