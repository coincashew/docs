<summary>Wen staking rewards?</summary>

**Activation Queue**: Once your EL+CL is synced, validator up and running, you just wait for activation. This process can take 24+ hours. Only 900 new validators can join per day. Check the queue length: [https://wenmerge.com ](https://wenmerge.com)

**Activated**: When you're activated, your validator will begin creating and voting on blocks while earning staking rewards.

**Quick monitoring**: Use [https://hoodi.beaconcha.in](https://hoodi.beaconcha.in) to create alerts and track your validator's performance.

<summary>Sync Timeline</summary>

Syncing the consensus client is instantaneous with checkpoint sync but the execution client can take up to a day. On nodes with fast NVME drives and gigabit internet, expect your node to be fully synced in a few hours.



**How do I know I'm fully synced?**

* Check your execution client's logs and compare the block number against the most recent block on [https://hoodi.etherscan.io](https://hoodi.etherscan.io)
  * Check EL logs: `journalctl -fu execution`
* Thanks to checkpoint sync, your consensus client's is instantly synched. You can compare the slot number against the most recent slot on [https://hoodi.beaconcha.in](https://hoodi.beaconcha.in)
  * Check CL logs: `journalctl -fu consensus`
